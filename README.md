# Bower buttons <img src="badge@2x.png" width="130" height="30">

Show that your project is available in Bower by using a bower badge!

### What to do

* On a github readme, show that your project is available in bower by placing the static badge next to the project name. (As above)
* On a site, you should use the embeddable bower button.
